U-Net is a kind of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for medical image segmentation1. U-Net has a symmetric structure that preserves the size of the input image and recovers lost features. 
The features of U-Net that distinguish it from CNN are as follows:

U-Net does not use padding to preserve information at the edges of the input image.
U-Net uses skip connections between the downsampling and upsampling layers. This allows low-level features to be combined with high-level features.
U-Net uses sigmoid activation function instead of softmax in the last layer to produce the segmentation map.
The working logic of U-Net is as follows:

The input image passes through four narrowing layers consisting of convolution, ReLU and max pooling. These layers create feature maps of the image.
The output of the contraction layers enters four expansion layers consisting of convolution, ReLU and transpose convolution. These layers approximate the segmentation map by upsampling the feature maps.
Each of the expansion layers establishes short links with the corresponding outputs of the collapse layers. In this way, lost features can be recovered.
The output of the last expansion layer enters the last convolution layer. This layer generates a class probability for each pixel using a sigmoid activation function
